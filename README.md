# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project concerns the prediction of 'Customer Status' among three choices: churned, stayed and joined. A dataset containing information on 7043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California has been used. Each record contains details about the demographics, location, tenure, subscription services and more (38 features in total) for each customer. 

Several models have been trained on the dataset which was subjected to various data engineering techniques. At the end a comparison of the scores provided by each model have been showed and analyzed. 

The present notebook is organized as follows:

1. **EDA**: Numerical analysis and Categorical analysis
2. **Modeling**: Logistic Regression and Feature engineering
3. **Handling Data Imbalance**
4. **Testing other models**: SVC, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
5. **Model Comparison and Final Remarks**
